    "When you run this flowgraph, it will stream data from the radio out to the file specified in the properties of the file sink block. Note you should only run this flowgraph for a few seconds before killing it. But what is this data? Well as we talked about earlier in this lesson, the key is to look at the color of the connection nodes. Between the two blocks, we see blue, which indicates this is `Complex Float 32` or a complex number represented by two 32-bit floating point numbers. Let's read this data into a numpy array and print some data."

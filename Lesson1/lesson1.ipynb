    "## What is an SDR?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Software Defined Radio, or SDR, is a radio in device in which traditionally analog devices, like phase shifters, mixers, etc., are implemented in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software defined radios have become very popular in more recent years as computing power has increased drastically. A typical SDR will have an RF front end, followed by some kind of analog to digital conversion to turn the incoming signal into a bitstream that can be manipulated by software, as well as a digital to analog convertor to allow for signals generated by software to be sent through the front end. The figure below shows the very basic version of this chain.\n",

    "These tutorials are mostly about using a gnuradio to develop SDR applications, and so this tutorial will focus on getting it up and running"

    "## What is gnuradio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gnuradio is an open source software ecosystem that helps to simplify the control of supported SDRs and the processing of the data captured by them. The whole set of softwares can be found on their [github](https://github.com/gnuradio). Here is a list of some of their more important repositories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [gnuradio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio): The primary repository of the gnuradio project. Provides a large amount of the signal processing \"blocks\" that can be pieced together to work with data captured from SDRs\n",
    "- [PyBOMBS](https://github.com/gnuradio/PyBOMBS): Python Build Overlay Managed Bundle System. PyBOMBS is used to manage installs of gnuradio and associated projects.\n",
    "- [gr-recipes](https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-recipes): PyBOMBS uses these recipe files to determine dependencies and build recipes of gnuradio and associated projects.\n",
    "- [gr-etcetera](https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-etcetera): Additional recipes for PyBOMBS not found in gr-recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "At it's core, gnuradio is a set of tools to develop for software defined radios. It includes a large number of signal processing functions, called \"blocks\", as well as a tool for connecting those blocks together into a cohesive application. Gnuradio also includes a program called gnuradio companion which provides a graphical user interface for combining these sets of block into something called a \"flowgraph\", so called because it visually represents the flow of information between blocks. It does this by taking the input from the GUI and generating the python code that is actually doing the processing. Much of the code in gnuradio is written in python, but a large amount of performance-critical code is written in C++ (often with python wrappers)"

    "\n",
    "*gnuradio is only available for Linux, and so your machine must either be running Linux or have a Linux virtual machine. Additionally, [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) might be the most stable distribution to work with. In order to reduce any issues, it might be best to install this version of Ubuntu either on your machine or in a virtual machine*\n",

    "The best way to install gnuradio is to use their tool, PyBOMBS. This means we must first get that tool installed. A version is available for most Linux distributions, so you can investigate the commands to install it if you would like to do it that way, but this tutorial will show you how to use Pythons package manager, pip. Perform the following steps in a shell.\n",

The throttle block limits the amount of samples being processed at a time so the CPU isn't overworked, and the QT GUI Time Sink block is what displays the signal. The connections we made show the flow of data. In general, sources generate data, sinks use the data, and blocks manipulate data. An example of a source would be getting received samples from an attached SDR. Those samples could then be manipulated by other blocks before being input in to a sink which can do things like display the data or be output to something like a speaker. To transmit using an SDR, the equivalent \"Sink\" block would be used because it is doing something with the samples received (in this case sending them to the radio). \n",

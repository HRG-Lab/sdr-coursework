sdr-getting-started
===================

Tutorials about software defined radios, and associated software / libraries

This repository contains the course material for Penn State's EE5XX, as well as
a basic introduction to gnuradio for anyone looking to get up and running
quickly. Each lesson in the Intro to SDR is a jupyter notebook with relevant
documentation, references, and screenshots. The material for the course is split
into 7 units, each of which cover a two week period.

This tutorial was written with gnuradio gr-maint branch, version 3.8 and uhd
version 3.5
